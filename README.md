# SDS315_HW2

Located in this repository is my RMD file with all the code for HW2 of SDS315. 3 of the 4 CSVs needed to reproduce my results are located here as well, with billboard.csv missing because it's too large. To reproduce my results, download SDS315_HW2.RMD, profs.csv, bikeshare.csv, capmetro_UT.csv, and billboard.csv, and put them all in the same working directory. From there, just run the RMD file. Necessary packages are listed at the top of the RMD file. This should reproduce my HW2 results.
